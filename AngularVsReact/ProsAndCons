# Other stuff useful to mention to make a decision

Differences are large but but accomplish the same thing. Angular is a much fuller featured framework than React, which isn’t really a framework at all, but that doesn’t mean a lot when I don’t see the need for most of the features that Angular provides. I’ve found that I have to write less code to do more in React, and React has better performance than Angular due to React’s implementation of a virtual DOM [1]

Library vs. Framework [2]


Angular:
Developer - Google
Technology type - Full-fledged MVC framework written in JavaScript
Concept - Brings JavaScript into HTML, Works with the real DOM, Client-side rendering
Data binding - Two-way data binding
Dependencies - Manages dependencies automatically
Language - JavaScript + HTML
[3]

React:
Developer - Facebook
Technology type - JavaScript library, (View in MVC; requires Flux to implement architecture)
Concept - Brings HTML into JavaScript, Works with the virtual DOM, Server-side rendering
Data binding - One-way data binding
Dependencies - Requires additional tools to manage dependencies
Language - JavaScript + JSX
