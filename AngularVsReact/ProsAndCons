# Collect all Pros and Cons for Angular and React

--------------------------------------------------------
Angular

Pros:
  1. Around longer than react (2009) [1]
  2. Wide use [2]
  3. Global community support [2]
  4. full-fledged framework [2]
  5. Two-way data bind [2] - updates view and model [3]
  6. TypeScript [2]
  7. component-based architecture [2]
  8. Solving dependencies [3]
  9. Lots of performance issues solved in Angular 2 (dirty checking) [4]

Cons:
  1. steep learning curve [2]
  2. complexity [2]
  3. Static
  4. Two-way data bind - worse performance [3]
  5. Performance - Too many watchers [3]
  6. Typescript [4]
  7.

--------------------------------------------------------
React

Pros:
 1. Increased rendering performance [1]
 2. Renders only changes (Good for lots of data) due to the Virtual DOM [1], [3]
 3. Wide use [2]
 4. JSX [2]
 5. Prompt rendering [2]
 6. JS-centric [2]
 7. Structure of the code [3]
 8. Easy to read [3]
 9. Lot of freedom [3]
 10. Debugging [3]


Cons:
  1. not a full-scale framework [2]
  2. Packages - (too) many options [3], finding best choices is hard [4]
  3. Solving dependencies - No concepts, but many tools [3]

# Other stuff useful to mention to make a decision

Differences are large but but accomplish the same thing. Angular is a much fuller featured framework than React, which isn’t really a framework at all, but that doesn’t mean a lot when I don’t see the need for most of the features that Angular provides. I’ve found that I have to write less code to do more in React, and React has better performance than Angular due to React’s implementation of a virtual DOM [1]

Library vs. Framework [2]

nice sum up in [3]


Angular:
Developer - Google
Technology type - Full-fledged MVC framework written in JavaScript
Concept - Brings JavaScript into HTML, Works with the real DOM, Client-side rendering
Data binding - Two-way data binding
Dependencies - Manages dependencies automatically
Language - JavaScript + HTML
[3]

React:
Developer - Facebook
Technology type - JavaScript library, (View in MVC; requires Flux to implement architecture)
Concept - Brings HTML into JavaScript, Works with the virtual DOM, Server-side rendering
Data binding - One-way data binding
Dependencies - Requires additional tools to manage dependencies
Language - JavaScript + JSX
