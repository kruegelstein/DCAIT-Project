# Decision due to the comparison

For this project it should be worth the work switching
to another frond-end technology, since GWT is limited
to the level of abstraction. We identified the following needs:

1. Performance and efficiency
2. Easy to learn and to maintain
3. Dealing with large (graph-)data sets

We decided to build the prototype with ReactJS.

The main reason is the virtual DOM which might give us an egde
on the performance side. Due to the virtual DOM only changed values are
re-rendered. For example having a list of 1 million items and changing
the value of only one item would also cause a change of one item
instead of 1 million. Taking this the graph interaction it could be quite
interesting.
We also think ReactJS could be better suited for this project since it is
a library. The project has limited range in the usage. We basically have
a list on the left side, an interactive graph in the center and options
on the right. A framework like AngularJS might be an overkill here.
With ReactJS we have slimmer solution and we load the suited packages
if we need them, for example working with graphs.
